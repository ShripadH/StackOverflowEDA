# StackOverflowEDA

Each year, we at Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year we’ve published our Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.

This year, we covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. We also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than we would expect from their participation in the workforce. Want to dive into the results yourself and see what you can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech? We look forward to seeing what you find!

Content This 2018 Developer Survey results are organized on Kaggle in two tables:

survey_results_public contains the main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per question

survey_results_schema contains each column name from the main results along with the question text corresponding to that column

There are 98,855 responses in this public data release. These responses are what we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey and included at least one non-PII question. Approximately 20,000 responses were started but not included here because respondents did not answer enough questions, or only answered questions with personally identifying information. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 completed the entire survey.

We will try to find inisight on Salary and AI views of respondents
